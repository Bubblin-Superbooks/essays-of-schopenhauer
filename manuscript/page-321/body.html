While <em>force of habit</em>, in reality, is solely due to <em>indolence</em> seeking to save the intellect and will the work, difficulty, and danger of making a fresh choice; so that we are made to do to-day what we did yesterday and have done a hundred times before, and of which we know that it will gain its end.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">But the truth of the matter lies deeper; for it can be explained more clearly than appears at first sight. The <em>power of inertia</em> applied to bodies which may be moved by mechanical means only, becomes <em>force of habit</em> when applied to bodies which are moved by motives. The actions which we do out of sheer force of habit occur, as a matter of fact, without any individual separate motive</p></div> </div>
