To be sure, Aristotle says "Suicide is a wrong against the State, although not against the person;" Stobfus, however, in his treatise on the Peripatetic ethics uses this sentence: <em>fe??t?? de t?? \</em>??? ????es?a? t??? 5e? ??a???? ?? ta?? ??a? ?t???a?? t??? de ?a???? ?a? ?? ta?? ??a? e?t???a??. (Vitam autem relinquendam esse bonis in nimiis quidem miseriis pravis vero in nimium quoque secundis_ And similarly: ??? ?a? ?a5?se??, ?a? pa?d?p???ses?a?, ?a? p???te?ses?a?, etc.; ?a? ?a????? t?? ??et?? ??????ta ?a? 5e?e?? ?? t? _??, ?a? pa???, e? de??, p?te d? ??a??a? ?pa??a??ses?a?, taf?? p?????sa?ta, etc. <em>(Ideoque et uxorem ducturum, et liberos procreaturum, et ad civitatem accessurum,</em> etc.; <em>atque omnino virtutem colendo tum vitam servaturum, tum iterum, cogente necessitate, relicturum,</em> etc.) And we find that suicide was actually praised by the Stoics as a noble and heroic act, this is corroborated by hundreds</p></div> </div>
