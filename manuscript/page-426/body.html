It is true that the persons concerned imagine they are promoting their own happiness; but their real aim, which is one they are unconscious of, is to bring forth an individual which can be begotten by them alone. This purpose having brought them together, they ought henceforth to try and make the best of things. But it very frequently happens that two people who have been brought together by this instinctive illusion, which is the essence of passionate love, are in every other respect temperamentally different. This becomes apparent when the illusion wears off, as it necessarily must.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Accordingly, people who marry for love are generally unhappy, for such people look after the welfare of the future generation at the expense of the present. <em>Quien se casa por amores, ha de vivir con dolores</em> (He who marries for love must live in grief), says the Spanish proverb.</p></div> </div>
