<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There is a more cunning and worse trick, albeit a profitable one. <em>Littirateurs</em>, hack-writers, and productive authors have succeeded, contrary to good taste and the true culture of the age, in bringing the world <em>elegante</em> into leading-strings, so that they have been taught to read <em>a tempo</em> and all the same thingâ€”namely, <em>the newest books</em> order that they may have material for conversation in their social circles. Bad novels and similar productions from the pen of writers who were once famous, such as Spindler, Bulwer, Eughne Sue, and so on, serve this purpose. But what can be more miserable than the fate of a reading public of this kind, that feels always impelled to read the latest writings of extremely commonplace authors who write for money only, and therefore exist in numbers? And for the sake of this they merely know by name the works of the rare and superior writers, of all ages and countries.</p></div> </div>
