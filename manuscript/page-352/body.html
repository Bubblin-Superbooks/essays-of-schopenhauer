It is a want of imagination and dulness of mind generally (??a?s??s?a ?a? _?ad?t?? ?????), as Theophrastus puts it, that prevents people from laughing when they are alone. The lower animals neither laugh when they are alone nor in company.</p><p>Nyson, the misanthropist, was surprised as he was laughing to himself by one of these people, who asked him why he laughed when he was alone. "That is just why I was laughing," was the answer.</p></div> </div>
